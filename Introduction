Introduction

K-Means clustering is one of the most widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithms for data analysis and pattern recognition. Unlike supervised learning techniques, clustering does not rely on labeled data; instead, it groups data points based on their similarity. The objective of K-Means is to partition a dataset into K distinct clusters such that the data points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

In this project, K-Means clustering is applied to an unlabelled dataset obtained from Kaggle, namely the Mall Customers Dataset. The dataset contains customer information such as annual income and spending score, which makes it suitable for customer segmentation. By identifying natural groupings in the data, clustering helps businesses understand customer behavior and make data-driven decisions related to marketing and customer relationship management.
